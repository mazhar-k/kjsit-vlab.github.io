		<p class="text-lg leading-7">
			Text summarization is the process of creating a condensed version of a text, while retaining its most
			important
			information, for applications such as news articles, academic papers, legal documents, and business reports.
			This allows
			readers to quickly find the information they need and provides a brief overview of a topic. Two main
			approaches to text
			summarization are extractive and abstractive, with extractive summarization selecting the most important
			sentences or
			phrases and concatenating them together, while abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences
			that capture
			the essence of the original text. Advances in natural language processing and machine learning have improved
			the
			accuracy, informativeness, conciseness, and readability of text summarization systems.

	<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
		<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Rule-Based Summarization</h1>
		<p class="text-lg leading-7">
			Rule-based summarization is a method that involves using pre-defined rules to extract sentences or phrases
			from
			a text that best represent its content. The rules can be based on various linguistic features such as
			keywords,
			sentence length, or part of speech. The extracted sentences are then combined to create a summary that
			captures
			the essence of the original text. Rule-based summarization is a straightforward and effective method, but it
			can
			be limited by the complexity of the rules and the ability to identify the most important information.

	<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
		<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Abstractive Summarization</h1>
		<p class="text-lg leading-7">
			Abstractive summarization is a more advanced method that involves creating a summary by generating new
			sentences
			that capture the essential information from a text. This technique involves using natural language
			processing
			and deep learning algorithms to understand the meaning of the text and generate new, concise sentences that
			convey the same meaning. Abstractive summarization can produce more fluent and natural summaries, but it can
			be
			challenging to develop accurate algorithms that can generate high-quality summaries.

	<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
		<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Graph-Based Summarization</h1>
		<p class="text-lg leading-7">
			Graph-based summarization is a method that involves representing the text as a graph, with sentences as
			nodes
			and relationships between sentences as edges. The graph is then analyzed to identify the most important
			sentences based on various criteria such as centrality, connectivity, and position. The selected sentences
			are
			then combined to create a summary that captures the essential information from the original text.
			Graph-based
			summarization can produce high-quality summaries, but it can be computationally intensive and requires
			advanced
			graph analysis techniques.

	<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
		<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Extractive Summarization</h1>
		<p class="text-lg leading-7">
			Extractive summarization is a method that involves selecting the most important sentences or phrases from a
			text
			and using them to create a summary. This technique involves using various algorithms such as sentence
			scoring or
			clustering to identify the most relevant information. Extractive summarization can produce summaries quickly
			and
			efficiently, but it can be limited by the ability to accurately identify the most critical sentences and
			phrases.
